              Stan Lee[1] (born Stanley Martin Lieber /ˈliːbər/; December 28,
              1922 – November 12, 2018) was an American comic book writer,
              editor, publisher, and producer. He rose through the ranks of a
              family-run business called Timely Comics which would later become
              Marvel Comics. He was the primary creative leader for two decades,
              leading its expansion from a small division of a publishing house
              to a multimedia corporation that dominated the comics and film
              industries.
